# Portuguese Automated Fact-Checking: Data Enrichment and Analysis

This repository contains the Python code and resources for the research paper: **"Portuguese Automated Fact-checking: Information Retrieval with Claim extraction"**.

Our work focuses on addressing the gap in Portuguese Automated Fact-Checking (AFC) by systematically enriching misinformation datasets with external web evidence. We simulate user information-seeking behavior, leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for core claim extraction, and apply a semi-automated validation framework to enhance dataset reliability.

The primary contributions of this research are:
1.  A methodology for enriching Portuguese misinformation datasets with web-retrieved evidence and LLM-extracted claims.
2.  Enriched versions of the COVID19.BR, Fake.BR, and MuMiN-PT datasets, associating original texts with retrieved evidence and claims.
3.  An analysis of how dataset characteristics impact data properties, evidence retrieval, and AFC model performance.
4.  Publicly available code and datasets (upon publication) to foster future evidence-based fact-checking research in Portuguese.

## Experimental Setup

We evaluated our methodologies fo Fake.BR and COVID19.BR using the following experimental configurations:
1.  **Original Data (Baseline):** Minimally preprocessed datasets.
2.  **Validated Data:** Datasets after our full semi-automatic validation workflow.
3.  **Validated and Enriched Data:**
    *   **Complete Enrichment:** Using the first Google API CSE search result.
    *   **Filtered Enrichment (No Social Media):** Excluding social media results from CSE searches.

Model performance was assessed via:
*   Supervised fine-tuning of the Portuguese SLM Bertimbau (base version).
*   Few-shot learning with the Gemini 1.5 Flash LLM.

A standardized 80/10/10 train/validation/test split was used.

##  Installation
1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **API Keys:**
    This project requires API keys in .env for:
    - `SEARCH_ID= [enable search mecanism and set id for Google CSE]`
    - `SEARCH_KEY= [user search key for Google CSE and Google FactCheck]`
    - `GEMINI_API_KEY=[Gemini api key]`

3.  **Docker (for hyperparameter search):**
    If you wish to run the hyperparameter search using Docker:
    ```bash
    docker build -t  .
    ```



## Running the Pipeline

The project is structured as a sequence of Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts:

1.  **`1_validation_cleaning.ipynb`**: Performs initial data loading, cleaning, and near-duplicate detection using the Akin library.
2.  **`2_enrichment.ipynb`**: Implements the data enrichment process using Google CSE API and LLM-based claim extraction (Gemini 1.5 Flash).
3.  **`3_google_factcheck.ipynb`**: Further enriches data by querying the Google FactCheck Claim Search API.
4.  **`4_make_splits.ipynb`**: Generates standardized train/validation/test splits for the datasets.
5.  **`5_hypersearch.py`**: Conducts hyperparameter search for fine-tuning the Bertimbau model on the prepared datasets.
6.  **`6_run_llm.py`**: Executes few-shot learning experiments using the Gemini 1.5 Flash LLM.

The `notebook_analysis/` directory contains notebooks for detailed analysis of the datasets, experimental procedures, and results.

The enriched datasets generated by this research, associating original texts with retrieved evidence and LLM-extracted claims, **will be made publicly available upon publication of the paper.** A link to the datasets will be provided here.
